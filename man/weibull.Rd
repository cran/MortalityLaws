\title{Weibull Mortality Law
Note that if sigma > m, then the mode of the density is 0 and hx is a 
non-increasing function of x, while if sigma < m, then the mode is 
greater than 0 and hx is an increasing function.
m > 0 is a measure of location
sigma > 0 is measure of dispersion}
\usage{
weibull(x, par = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of age at the beginning of the age classes}

\item{par}{parameters of the selected model. If NULL the 
\code{\link{bring_parameters}} function will provide default values.}
