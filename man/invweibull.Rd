\title{Inverse-Weibull Mortality Law
The Inverse-Weibull proves useful for modeling the childood and teenage years, 
because the logarithm of h(x) is a very concave function.
m > 0 is a measure of location
sigma > 0 is measure of dispersion}
\usage{
invweibull(x, par = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of age at the beginning of the age classes}

\item{par}{parameters of the selected model. If NULL the 
\code{\link{bring_parameters}} function will provide default values.}
