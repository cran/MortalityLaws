\usage{
find.my.case(Dx, Ex, mx, qx, lx, dx)
}
\arguments{
\item{Dx}{object containing death counts. An element of the \code{Dx} object, 
represents the number of deaths during the year to persons aged x to x+n.}

\item{Ex}{exposure in the period. \code{Ex} can be approximated by the 
mid-year population aged x to x+n}

\item{mx}{age-specific death rates}

\item{qx}{probability of dying between age x and x+n.}

\item{lx}{probability to survive up until age x}

\item{dx}{life table death counts at age x}
