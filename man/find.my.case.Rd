\usage{
find.my.case(Dx = NULL, Ex = NULL, mx = NULL, qx = NULL, lx = NULL,
  dx = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Dx}{Object containing death counts. An element of the \code{Dx} object 
represents the number of deaths during the year to persons aged x to x+n.}

\item{Ex}{Exposure in the period. \code{Ex} can be approximated by the 
mid-year population aged x to x+n.}

\item{mx}{Death rate in age interval [x, x+n).}

\item{qx}{Probability of dying in age interval [x, x+n).}

\item{lx}{Probability of survival up until age x.}

\item{dx}{Deaths by life-table population in the age interval [x, x+n).}
