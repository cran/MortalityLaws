version 1.7.0
- New models: Kannisto-Makeham (1998) and Strehler-Mildvan (1960);
- ReadHMD() new functionalities. The function can now download cohort life tables, cohort life expectancy and exposure-to-risk by Lexis triangles data.

version 1.6.0
- convertFx(): New function! Easy conversion between the life table indicators;
- MortalityLaws(): Remove scale.x argument. Now, the function will identify 
by default which laws require a scaled x in fitting;
- MortalityLaws(): When a mortality law is fitted on a subset of the input data, 
using fit.this.x argument, the residuals and fitted values are computed and plotted for 
the entire age range (in input). Previously only the fitted values followed this 
approach;
- MortalityLaw(): set the argument `show = FALSE` as default; 
- Drop `diagram` suggestion from DESCRIPTION and vignettes.

version 1.5.0
- LawTable(): Compute life tables from parameters of a mortality law;
- Fix bug in the ReadHMD() function due to HMD migration from http to https.

version 1.4.0
- Compute e[x] at the beginning of the age interval in LifeTable(). This affects only the ex column in the life table, all the other indicator remain unchanged;
- New mortality model: Gamma-Gompertz (Vaupel.1979 version);
- Fix bug related to fit.this.x argument in MortalityLaws();
- More rigorous referencing in avalaibleLaws() function.

version 1.3.0
- Add generic functions: deviance, df.residual;
- Update vignette.

version 1.2.0
- Vignettes;
- Fix predict.MortalityLaws bug for cases where the input is of class matrix;
- Solution for 'Kostaki' inflexion point due to high correlation between estimated parameters;
- Add 'scale.x' argument in MortalityLaw function;
- Add 'ax' argument in LifeTable function;
- Add 'show' argument in ReadHMD function;
- Other minor changes.

version 1.0.5
- Fix issues with minpack.lm not being imported.

version 1.0.0:
- First stable version (on CRAN).
